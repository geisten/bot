    """Returns a function to predict the buy/sell probability
        The code computes a [moving_average_windows] moving average (MA).
        RSI is computed over [rsi_window] hours.
        If the price dips below a certain percentage below the MA, and
        if the RSI is below a threshold, it will try to buy.

        Once the price rises to a fixed percentage above the buy price, it will sell.

        It never, ever sells below the buy price, which means it has no stop-loss.

        The algorithm is intended to capture a small amount of profit as the price of the coin
        oscillates up and down. If the prices are overall flat or slowly climbing, it works well.
        If prices are climbing sharply over time, as it has for much of 2020, it will not perform
        as well as buy/hold. If the prices are declining over time, it will buy, and then get stuck
         â€” since it never sells below buy price, it will hold as the price drops.
        This is the primary risk that I can identify.

        The algorithm is thus best suited for periods where you are seeing regular swings up and down,
        but the prices are not sharply climbing or descending.

        Parameters
        ------------
        buy_limit: float
            The general buy limit
        sell_limit: float
